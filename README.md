# üì∞ Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview

This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**. The objective is to classify news content as *Real* or *Fake* based solely on the textual information. A **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model was trained on TF-IDF-transformed data, achieving an accuracy of around **90%**. A simple **Flask web app** allows users to input news text and get real-time predictions.

## üìä Project Stages

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed punctuation, stopwords
   - Converted text to lowercase
   - Tokenized text using `NLTK`

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transformed text data into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
   - Used 5000 top terms for vectorization

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model on the TF-IDF vectors
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Achieved ~90% accuracy
   - Evaluated using **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**

5. **Web Deployment**:
   - Built a **Flask application**
   - Users can paste any news article to get a prediction instantly
